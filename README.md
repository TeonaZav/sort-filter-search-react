# Sort Filter and Search

This project demonstrates how to implement search, sort, and filter functionalities in a React application. It uses a combination of manual methods and popular libraries like Fuse.js for searching and Lodash for sorting. Styled-components are used for styling the application, and @mui and react-select enhance the UI components.
